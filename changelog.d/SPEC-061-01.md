## SPEC-061-01: Installation Flow Smoke Test

### Summary
Verified the installation flow end-to-end and fixed issues found during smoke testing.

### Changes
- Fixed Qdrant health check endpoint from `/readiness` to `/healthz` (was returning 404 on Qdrant v1.12.1)
- Added `--skip-qdrant` suggestion to all Docker dependency error messages
- Improved dependency check output to show both found and required versions on mismatch
- Fixed dry-run directory step to show "All directories already exist" instead of blank output
- Enhanced uninstall.sh data deletion warning to itemize what will be lost (metadata.db, memories, etc.)
- Added 23 unit tests for the install module (dependencies, directory creation, health checks, result tracking)
- Updated SYSTEM_AUDIT.md to reflect correct `/healthz` endpoint
