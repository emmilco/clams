## BUG-066: Fix claws-worktree merge to auto-update task phase

### Summary
Fixed a bug where `claws-worktree merge` would clear the worktree_path but not update the task phase, causing tasks to remain in stale phases after merge.

### Changes
- Modified `cmd_merge()` to query task_type and current_phase before merge
- Added auto-transition logic after successful merge:
  - Bug tasks → DONE (merge is final step)
  - Feature tasks → VERIFY (need verification on main)
- Added logging of phase transitions for visibility

### Impact
- Prevents database drift where tasks show wrong phases
- Closes the gap between merge and phase update
- Matches user mental model (merge = task progresses)
