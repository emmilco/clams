## BUG-054: Test isolation fixture for resource leaks

### Summary
Added a pytest fixture that tracks and cleans up resources (async tasks, threads) created during tests, making resource leaks explicit failures.

### Changes
- Added `resource_tracker` fixture to tests/conftest.py that captures baseline state before each test
- Fixture compares state after test and attempts cleanup of leaked resources
- Tests explicitly fail if cleanup was required, preventing silent hangs
