## BUG-025: InMemoryVectorStore missing range filter support

### Summary
Fixed missing range filter support in `InMemoryVectorStore._apply_filters()` that caused date-filtered searches to return empty results.

### Changes
- Enhanced `_apply_filters()` to detect and handle operator-based filters
- Added `_match_operators()` helper supporting `$gte`, `$lte`, `$gt`, `$lt`, `$in` operators
- Maintains backward compatibility with simple equality filters
- Now matches QdrantVectorStore filter behavior
