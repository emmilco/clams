## SPEC-058-01: CALM Foundation - Package structure and core infrastructure

### Summary
Created the CALM (Claude Agent Learning & Management) Python package alongside the existing clams package. This establishes the foundation for the unified system that will eventually replace the separate clams MCP server and claws bash scripts.

### Changes
- Added `calm` CLI with Click framework (`calm init`, `calm server`, `calm status`)
- Created database schema with 8 tables (sessions, memories, code_files, code_chunks, commits, ghap_entries, settings, values)
- Implemented MCP server skeleton with ping tool on port 6335
- Added daemon management for server lifecycle (start/stop/status/restart)
- Configured pydantic-settings for environment-based configuration
- Added 21 tests covering CLI, config, and database schema
- Passes mypy --strict type checking
