## BUG-031: Clustering not forming with 63 GHAP entries

### Summary
Fixed HDBSCAN parameters that were too conservative for typical GHAP data distributions, causing all points to be classified as noise.

### Changes
- Changed `min_cluster_size` from 5 to 3
- Changed `min_samples` from 3 to 2
- Parameters now better suited for datasets with 20-100 thematically similar entries
- Added regression test to verify clustering forms with similar embeddings
