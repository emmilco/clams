## SPEC-002-13: ValueStore Validation and Storage

### Summary
Implemented the ValueStore module for validating and storing agent-generated values derived from experience clusters. Provides server-side infrastructure for agent-driven value formation workflow.

### Changes
- Added `src/learning_memory_server/values/types.py` with dataclasses (ValidationResult, Value, ClusterInfo, Experience)
- Added `src/learning_memory_server/values/store.py` with ValueStore implementation
- Implemented validation using centroid distance threshold (mean + 0.5 * std)
- Added cluster access methods (get_clusters, get_cluster_members)
- Added value storage with embedding and metadata
- Added value listing with axis filtering and recency sorting
- Created comprehensive unit tests (28 test cases, 100% coverage)
- Created integration tests with real embedding service and vector store

### Notes
- Validation threshold set to mean + 0.5 * std (conservative, as per proposal)
- VALID_AXES excludes "domain" (it's a metadata filter, not a clustering axis)
- Cluster ID format: {axis}_{label}
- Value ID format: value_{axis}_{cluster_label}_{uuid8}
- Dependencies: Clusterer (SPEC-002-12) - mocked in tests until implementation complete
