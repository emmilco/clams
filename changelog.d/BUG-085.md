## BUG-085: Add MCP server health detection to session_start hook

### Summary
Added HTTP health check to detect when the MCP server process is alive but not responding, and warn users to restart.

### Changes
- Added `check_server_health()` helper to `src/calm/hooks/common.py` that pings the server's `/health` endpoint
- Updated `session_start.py` to perform HTTP health check after PID-based liveness check
- Added `server_unhealthy` parameter to `format_output()` for displaying health warnings
- When server is unresponsive, hook output now includes: "[WARNING] MCP server process is running but not responding. Run `calm server restart` and start a new Claude Code session."
- Added 8 regression tests covering health check success/failure and hook integration
