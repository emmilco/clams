## BUG-089: Fix shell breakage after worktree merge from inside worktree

### Summary
`calm worktree merge` and `calm worktree remove` now refuse to proceed if the
shell's current working directory is inside the target worktree, preventing an
unrecoverable broken shell state.

### Changes
- Changed `_warn_if_cwd_inside_worktree` to `_refuse_if_cwd_inside_worktree` in CLI worktree commands
- Warning upgraded to a hard error (`ClickException`) with actionable message
- Added 5 regression tests covering CWD-inside-worktree scenarios
