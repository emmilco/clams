## BUG-056: Pre-commit hook for subprocess.run stdin

### Summary
Added a pre-commit hook that checks for subprocess.run/Popen calls without explicit stdin handling.

### Changes
- Added custom hook to .pre-commit-config.yaml that greps for subprocess calls without stdin=
- Hook prevents commits with subprocess calls that could hang waiting for input
- Added regression test to verify the check works
