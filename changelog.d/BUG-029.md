## BUG-029: GHAP start should error when active entry exists

### Summary
Fixed `start_ghap` to return a helpful error when an active GHAP entry already exists instead of silently orphaning it.

### Changes
- Modified `start_ghap` handler to check for active entry and return `active_ghap_exists` error type
- Error message now includes the active GHAP ID and suggests using `resolve_ghap`
- Added regression test to verify helpful error behavior
