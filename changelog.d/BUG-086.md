## BUG-086: Gate check pytest timeout too tight for growing test suite

### Summary
Increased the gate check pytest timeout from a hardcoded 300s to a configurable 600s default, preventing spurious gate failures as the test suite grows.

### Changes
- Added `gate_test_timeout` setting to `CalmSettings` in `src/calm/config.py` (default: 600s, configurable via `CALM_GATE_TEST_TIMEOUT` env var)
- Replaced hardcoded `timeout=300` in `_check_tests_pass` with `settings.gate_test_timeout`
- Added `timeout=settings.gate_test_timeout` to both pytest calls in `_check_no_skipped` (previously had no timeout)
- Added regression tests verifying default value, env var configurability, and usage in gate check functions
