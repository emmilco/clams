## BUG-060: Detect file overlaps when creating worktree

### Summary
Added overlap detection to `claws-worktree create` to prevent merge conflicts between parallel tasks.

### Changes
- Added `--check-overlaps` flag to detect potential file conflicts before creating a worktree
- Added `--force` flag to bypass overlap warnings
- Added `check_overlaps()` function that scans all worktrees for uncommitted changes and file mentions in planning docs
- Reports conflicting task IDs with recommendations for resolution
