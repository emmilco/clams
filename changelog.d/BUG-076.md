## BUG-076: MCP client does not reconnect after server restart

### Summary
Migrated the CALM MCP server from the deprecated SSE transport to the Streamable HTTP transport, enabling automatic client reconnection after server restarts.

### Changes
- Replaced `SseServerTransport` with `StreamableHTTPSessionManager` in `src/calm/server/main.py`
- Changed the MCP endpoint from `/sse` to `/mcp` using Starlette `Mount`
- Added a lifespan context manager to manage the session manager lifecycle
- Updated `src/calm/install/config_merge.py` to register the server with `type: "http"` instead of `type: "sse"`
- Updated CORS middleware to allow DELETE method for session termination
- Added regression tests verifying the transport migration
