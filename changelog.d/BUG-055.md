## BUG-055: Mark and exclude slow tests

### Summary
Configured pytest to support a `@pytest.mark.slow` marker and exclude slow tests from default runs.

### Changes
- Added `slow` marker definition to pyproject.toml
- Configured default addopts to exclude slow tests with `-m "not slow"`
- Tests taking >15 seconds can now be marked and excluded from gate checks
