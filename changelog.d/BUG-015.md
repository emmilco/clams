## BUG-015: Fix list_ghap_entries internal server error

### Summary
Fixed a regression where `list_ghap_entries` MCP tool returned internal server error due to missing GHAP collections.

### Changes
- Added `ensure_collections()` call in `list_ghap_entries` tool to create GHAP collections if they don't exist
- Collections are now lazily created on first access rather than requiring pre-initialization
