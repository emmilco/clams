## SPEC-002-12: Clusterer HDBSCAN

### Summary
Implemented HDBSCAN-based clustering for experiences and memories with weighted centroid computation. Supports all 4 experience axes (full, strategy, surprise, root_cause) and memory clustering with uniform weights.

### Changes
- Added `Clusterer` class wrapping scikit-learn HDBSCAN with configurable parameters
- Added `ExperienceClusterer` for experience clustering with confidence tier weights (gold=1.0, silver=0.8, bronze=0.5, abandoned=0.2)
- Added weighted centroid computation formula: `centroid = Σ(wᵢ * eᵢ) / Σ(wᵢ)`
- Added 10k scroll limit warning for large datasets
- Added `ClusterInfo` and `ClusterResult` dataclasses for type-safe results
- Added `ConfidenceWeights` utility for tier-to-weight mapping
- Added comprehensive test suite (36 tests) with unit, integration, and property-based tests
