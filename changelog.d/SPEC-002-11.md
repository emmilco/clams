## SPEC-002-11: MCP Tools for Memory, Code, Git

### Summary

Implemented 13 MCP tools across 3 modules (memory, code, git) that expose the Learning Memory Server's functionality through the Model Context Protocol. Tools use strict input validation, graceful degradation for unavailable services, and comprehensive error handling.

### Changes

**Core Implementation**
- Added `ServiceContainer` class for dependency injection of shared services
- Added `initialize_services()` with graceful degradation for optional dependencies
- Added `register_all_tools()` to orchestrate tool registration
- Created common error types: `MCPError`, `ValidationError`, `StorageError`, `EmbeddingError`, `GitError`

**Memory Tools** (4 tools)
- Added `store_memory`: Store memories with semantic embedding (strict validation, no silent truncation)
- Added `retrieve_memories`: Semantic search with category and importance filters
- Added `list_memories`: Non-semantic listing with pagination (offset/limit)
- Added `delete_memory`: Soft deletion by ID

**Code Tools** (3 tools)
- Added `index_codebase`: Index source code directories for semantic search
- Added `search_code`: Semantic code search with project and language filters
- Added `find_similar_code`: Find similar code snippets by embedding

**Git Tools** (4 tools)
- Added `search_commits`: Semantic commit search with author and date filters
- Added `get_file_history`: Get commit history for specific files
- Added `get_churn_hotspots`: Find files with highest change frequency
- Added `get_code_authors`: Get author contribution statistics per file

**Configuration**
- Added `repo_path` field to `ServerSettings` for git repository location

**Testing**
- Added 42 unit tests covering all tools and validation cases
- Added shared test fixtures for mocking services
- Tests verify graceful degradation when optional services unavailable

### Technical Details

- All tools use async/await consistently
- VectorStore filter operators (`$gte`, `$in`) used for advanced filtering
- Strict input validation with helpful error messages (no silent clamping/truncation per spec)
- Structured logging (structlog) for all operations
- Timezone-aware timestamps (UTC) in ISO 8601 format
- Tools registered even when dependencies (SPEC-002-06, 07, 09) incomplete
- 100% test pass rate (42 tests), all linter checks passed
