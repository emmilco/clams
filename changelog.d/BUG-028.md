## BUG-028: Hash/Eq contract violation in ContextItem

### Summary
Fixed hash/eq contract violation in `ContextItem` class that caused incorrect behavior when using items in sets or as dict keys.

### Changes
- Modified `__hash__()` to include `len(self.content)` in the hash tuple
- Items with same source and prefix but different lengths now hash differently
- Maintains performance by still only hashing first 100 characters
