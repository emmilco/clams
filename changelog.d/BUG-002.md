## BUG-002: Git tools auto-detection fix

### Summary
Fixed git tools returning "not available" errors by adding automatic repository detection from the current working directory when `repo_path` is not explicitly configured.

### Changes
- Added auto-detection logic in `initialize_services()` using GitPython's `Repo(search_parent_directories=True)`
- Updated config docstring to document that `repo_path` is auto-detected from CWD if not set
- Added regression tests for auto-detection, explicit config override, and graceful failure scenarios

### Root Cause
The `initialize_services()` function only created a `GitAnalyzer` when `settings.repo_path` was explicitly configured. Since `repo_path` defaults to `None` and most users don't set the `LMS_REPO_PATH` environment variable, git tools were never initialized even when the server was running inside a git repository.

### Files Changed
- `src/learning_memory_server/server/tools/__init__.py` (auto-detection logic)
- `src/learning_memory_server/server/config.py` (docstring update)
- `tests/server/test_git_auto_detection.py` (new regression tests)
