## TASK-001: Improve GHAP uptake via session start hook messaging

### Summary
Revised the GHAP instructions in the session start hook to address psychological barriers to adoption: friction of starting, ambiguity about scope, and optimism bias.

### Changes
- Updated GHAP messaging in `clams/hooks/session_start.sh` to emphasize starting GHAP *before* investigation, not after something breaks
- Added 3 concrete "when to start" examples showing internal thought processes
- Added 3 concrete "when to skip" examples for explicit tasks and simple changes
- Reframed tool usage as quick ("30 sec") to reduce perceived overhead
- Moved tool list to the end to deemphasize mechanics vs. mindset
