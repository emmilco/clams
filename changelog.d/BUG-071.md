## BUG-071: Fix task list from worktrees, document --include-done, add next-id

### Summary
Fixed `calm task list` returning "No tasks found" when run from a worktree, documented
the undiscoverable `--include-done` flag, and added a `calm task next-id` command.

### Changes
- Changed `create_task()` and `list_tasks()` to use `detect_main_repo()` instead of
  `detect_project_path()`, so project filtering always uses the main repo path even
  when running from a worktree
- Documented the `--include-done` flag in CLAUDE.md CLI reference
- Added `get_next_task_id()` function and `calm task next-id <BUG|SPEC>` CLI command
  to query the next available task ID for a given prefix
- Added 9 regression tests covering worktree path resolution, include_done filtering,
  and next-id generation
