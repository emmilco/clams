## BUG-075: Editable install conflicts between worktrees

### Summary
Fixed PEP 660 editable install causing worktree tests to import from the main
repo instead of the worktree's own code. Workers' code changes are now correctly
tested during gate checks.

### Changes
- Added sys.path injection at the top of `tests/conftest.py` to ensure the
  project's own `src/` takes priority over the `.pth` file from the editable
  install
- Added `PYTHONPATH` override in `src/calm/orchestration/gates.py` for
  subprocess calls (pytest, mypy) so gate check subprocesses also resolve
  imports from the worktree's `src/`
- Added regression tests in `tests/test_import_isolation.py` verifying that
  `calm` imports from the correct `src/` directory
