## BUG-034: Float timeout truncation in QdrantVectorStore may cause zero timeout

### Summary
Fixed float timeout values being truncated to integers, which could cause 0.5s timeouts to become 0 (infinite wait).

### Changes
- Removed `int()` cast on timeout values in `QdrantVectorStore.__init__`
- Float timeouts are now passed directly to `AsyncQdrantClient`
- Added regression tests to verify sub-second and decimal timeouts are preserved

### Root Cause
The `int()` truncation on lines 59 and 65 of `src/clams/storage/qdrant.py` converted float timeouts to integers. This caused `int(0.5) = 0`, which in httpx means "no timeout" (infinite wait).
