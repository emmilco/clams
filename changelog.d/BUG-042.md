## BUG-042: Fix daemon crash on macOS due to MPS fork safety

### Summary
Fixed a critical bug where the CLAMS daemon crashed immediately after starting on macOS with Apple Silicon. The crash was caused by PyTorch's MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) being initialized before the daemon process forked.

### Root Cause
The daemon used `os.fork()` for daemonization, but PyTorch MPS crashes when `fork()` is called after MPS initialization (which happens automatically when torch is imported on Apple Silicon Macs).

### Changes
- Changed `daemonize()` to use `subprocess.Popen(start_new_session=True)` instead of `os.fork()`, spawning a fresh Python process that imports PyTorch independently
- Restructured `main.py` to defer all heavy imports until after daemonization
- Made embedding module imports lazy - concrete classes (MiniLM, Nomic) are now imported only when accessed
- Updated all test files to import concrete embedding classes from their specific modules

### Impact
- Daemon now starts reliably on macOS with Apple Silicon
- No changes to runtime behavior once started
- Minor import path changes for tests (use `from clams.embedding.nomic import NomicEmbedding` instead of `from clams.embedding import NomicEmbedding`)
