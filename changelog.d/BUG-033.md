## BUG-033: MCP client spawns new server instead of using existing one

### Summary
Fixed the MCP hook client to use the correct server binary path, resolving slow hook startup times and connection failures.

### Changes
- Updated `mcp_client.py` to compute the correct absolute path to `.venv/bin/clams-server` from the script location
- Fixed `config.yaml` to reference the correct server command instead of stale `["python", "-m", "learning_memory_server"]`
- Added regression tests to verify the correct server command is used

### Root Cause
The MCP client was using an incorrect server command `["python", "-m", "clams"]` which:
1. Used system python instead of venv python
2. Referenced a non-existent module entry point
This caused connection failures and 10+ second delays on hook startup.
