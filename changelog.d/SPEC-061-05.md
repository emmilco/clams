## SPEC-061-05: CLI Functional Verification

### Summary
Verified every `calm` CLI subcommand works correctly, fixed a bug where
`calm review record` with a nonexistent task produced a raw Python
traceback, and added comprehensive test coverage.

### Changes
- Fixed `calm review record` to catch `sqlite3.IntegrityError` and show
  a clean error message when given a nonexistent task ID
- Added `tests/calm/test_cli_server.py` with 13 tests covering all
  server subcommands (start, stop, status, restart)
- Added `tests/calm/test_cli_help_and_errors.py` with 85 tests covering
  `--help` for every command/subcommand and error handling for missing
  and invalid arguments
- Added tests for `task update`, `task delete`, and `task next-id` to
  `tests/calm/test_cli_task.py`
- Added tests for `review record` with nonexistent task, worker ID,
  missing args, and invalid types/results to `tests/calm/test_cli_review.py`
