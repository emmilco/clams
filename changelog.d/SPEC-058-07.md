## SPEC-058-07: CALM Cutover - Switch from Old to New System

### Summary
One-off migration script to switch from the old CLAMS/CLAWS system to the unified CALM system. Migrates all orchestration data, updates configuration, and rewrites CLAUDE.md.

### Changes
- Added `scripts/cutover.py`: migration script with 8 sequential phases
  - Backs up all source databases and config files before modification
  - Migrates code indexing tables from `~/.clams/metadata.db`
  - Migrates orchestration data from `.claude/claws.db` with proper column renames
  - Handles worker status mapping (idle->completed, stale->session_ended)
  - Updates `~/.claude.json` (MCP server) and `~/.claude/settings.json` (hooks)
  - Supports `--dry-run` mode and is idempotent
- Updated `CLAUDE.md`: replaced all CLAWS bash script references with CALM CLI commands
  - Documents `/orchestrate` skill activation model
  - Documents always-active memory features
  - Updates role file paths to `~/.calm/roles/`
- Added `tests/test_cutover.py`: 60 integration tests covering all migration paths
