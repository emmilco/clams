## SPEC-061-08: First-Run Experience

### Summary
Improved the first-run experience for new CALM installations by adding model download progress logging, clearer error messages for network failures, and first-run documentation.

### Changes
- Added pre-loading log messages in EmbeddingRegistry so server.log shows when model downloads begin (with size hints)
- Renamed registry log events from `*.loaded` to `*.loading`/`*.ready` for clearer lifecycle visibility
- Added specific OSError handling in MiniLMEmbedding and NomicEmbedding with actionable error messages mentioning network connectivity and HuggingFace Hub
- Added "First Run After Installation" section to GETTING_STARTED.md explaining model downloads, expected delays, and verification steps
- Added troubleshooting entry for slow/failing first tool calls due to model downloads
