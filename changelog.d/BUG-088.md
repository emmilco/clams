## BUG-088: Hooks fail silently with no logging or visibility

### Summary
Added file-based error logging to all Claude Code hooks so that hook failures
are recorded in ~/.calm/hook_errors.log instead of being silently discarded.

### Changes
- Added `log_hook_error()` helper and `get_hook_error_log_path()` to `common.py`
- Added log rotation (1 MB max, keeps 1 backup as hook_errors.log.1)
- Updated all 10 exception handlers across session_start.py, user_prompt_submit.py, pre_tool_use.py, and post_tool_use.py to log errors
- Updated 1 exception handler in skill_loader.py
- Stdout behavior unchanged (empty string on error, does not break Claude Code)
- Added 19 regression tests covering log creation, content format, rotation, stdout silence, and per-hook logging
