## BUG-022: Pagination bug in _delete_file_units

### Summary
Fixed a pagination bug in `CodeIndexer._delete_file_units()` that left orphaned entries in the vector store when a file had more than 1000 semantic units.

### Changes
- Modified `_delete_file_units()` to use a `while True` loop instead of a single `scroll()` call
- Now continues deleting until all entries are removed, regardless of count
- Added `total_deleted` counter for accurate logging
