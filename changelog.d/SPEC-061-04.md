## SPEC-061-04: MCP Tool Functional Verification

### Summary
Verified all 29 registered MCP tools return real results (no stubs or not_implemented responses), fixed two attribute-name bugs in git tools, and added missing happy-path tests.

### Changes
- Fixed `get_file_history` tool: `c.committed_at` -> `c.timestamp` (matched Commit dataclass)
- Fixed `get_code_authors` tool: `a.email` -> `a.author_email`, `a.line_count`/`a.percentage` -> computed from `a.commit_count`/`a.lines_added`/`a.lines_removed` (matched AuthorStats dataclass)
- Added happy-path test for `get_file_history` with mock commit data
- Added happy-path test for `get_code_authors` with mock author stats
- Added happy-path test for `index_codebase` with mock CodeIndexer
- Added functional test for `ping` tool verifying healthy status response
- Added stub-detection test for `ping` tool
- Confirmed zero stub/not_implemented responses across entire src/ tree
