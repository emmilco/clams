## BUG-024: Error message mismatch between InMemoryVectorStore and Searcher

### Summary
Fixed error message inconsistency that prevented proper error conversion in the Searcher class when using InMemoryVectorStore.

### Changes
- Changed all error messages in `InMemoryVectorStore` from "does not exist" to "not found"
- Now matches the pattern expected by Searcher's `CollectionNotFoundError` conversion logic
- Updated 7 methods: delete_collection, search, upsert, scroll, count, get, delete
