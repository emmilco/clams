## BUG-082: Restore pre-commit hooks deleted during CALM migration

### Summary
Restored pre-commit hook scripts that were accidentally deleted by SPEC-058-08 during the CLAMS-to-CALM migration. Updated `clams` path references to `calm` in the heavy imports checker.

### Changes
- Restored `.claude/hooks/check_heavy_imports.py` with `clams` → `calm` path updates in ALLOWED_MODULES
- Restored `.claude/hooks/check_subprocess.py` (no path changes needed)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` was already tracked in HEAD; no changes needed
- Added 10 regression tests verifying hook existence, functionality, and path correctness
