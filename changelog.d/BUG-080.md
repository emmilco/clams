## BUG-080: Remove 5 dead MCP session/counter tools

### Summary
Removed 5 MCP tools that were made obsolete when hooks were rewritten to use
file-based state instead of MCP calls. The hooks now use direct file I/O and
SQLite queries, making these tools dead code.

### Changes
- Removed `start_session`, `get_orphaned_ghap`, `should_check_in`, `increment_tool_count`, `reset_tool_count` tool definitions from `app.py`
- Deleted `src/calm/tools/session.py` (SessionManager class, validate_frequency, get_session_tools)
- Removed `get_session_tools` from `src/calm/tools/__init__.py`
- Removed associated test files and test classes
- Updated `scripts/verify_calm_setup.md` to reflect 29 tools (was 34)
- Added regression test (`test_bug_080_regression.py`) verifying removed tools stay removed
