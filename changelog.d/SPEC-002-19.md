## SPEC-002-19: Hook Scripts and Context Injection

### Summary
Implemented Claude Code hook scripts that integrate the Learning Memory Server with agent sessions. Hooks run at specific conversation lifecycle points (session start, user prompt, tool calls) to inject context, check GHAP state, and auto-capture outcomes.

### Changes
- Added `.claude/hooks/mcp_client.py`: Python MCP client utility for shell scripts to call MCP tools
- Added `.claude/hooks/session_start.sh`: Initialize session state and inject light context
- Added `.claude/hooks/user_prompt_submit.sh`: Analyze user intent and inject rich context (v1: no domain detection)
- Added `.claude/hooks/ghap_checkin.sh`: Remind agent to update GHAP state periodically
- Added `.claude/hooks/outcome_capture.sh`: Auto-capture test/build outcomes and prompt for GHAP resolution
- Added `.claude/hooks/session_end.sh`: Session cleanup (future use, not yet supported by Claude Code)
- Added `.claude/hooks/config.yaml`: Hook configuration file
- Added comprehensive tests in `tests/hooks/test_mcp_client.py`
- All hooks use `set -uo pipefail` with explicit error handling and graceful degradation
- All Python code uses strict type hints and passes `mypy --strict`

### Implementation Notes
- v1 simplification: No domain-specific premortem detection. The `user_prompt_submit.sh` hook calls `assemble_context(query=prompt)` without domain detection
- All hooks exit with code 0 (graceful degradation) even on errors
- MCP client returns empty dict `{}` on connection failures
- Hook scripts require `jq` for JSON parsing
- Hooks are made executable via `chmod +x`
