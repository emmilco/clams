## BUG-078: Add Qdrant snapshot support to backup system

### Summary
Fixed backup system to include Qdrant vector store snapshots alongside SQLite database copies, ensuring memories, GHAP entries, and values are not lost.

### Changes
- Added `create_qdrant_snapshot()` async function that creates a full Qdrant snapshot and downloads it locally
- Added `restore_qdrant_snapshot()` async function that uploads a snapshot file to restore Qdrant data
- Updated `create_backup()` to attempt Qdrant snapshot after SQLite copy (graceful degradation if unreachable)
- Updated `restore_backup()` to restore Qdrant snapshot if present
- Updated `auto_backup()` to rotate Qdrant snapshot files alongside SQLite backups
- Updated `delete_backup()` to remove Qdrant snapshot files alongside SQLite backups
- Extended `Backup` dataclass with `has_qdrant_snapshot` and `qdrant_snapshot_path` fields
- Updated `list_backups()` to detect and report Qdrant snapshot presence
- Updated CLI commands to display Qdrant snapshot status
- Added regression tests for all backup scenarios with mock Qdrant client
