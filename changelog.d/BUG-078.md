## BUG-078: Fix Qdrant backup/restore to use per-collection snapshots

### Summary
Fixed backup system to use per-collection Qdrant snapshots instead of full-storage snapshots. The previous implementation used `create_full_snapshot()` for backup (which worked) but `POST /snapshots/upload` for restore (a non-existent Qdrant API endpoint). Switched to per-collection `create_snapshot()` and `POST /collections/{name}/snapshots/upload` which are both valid Qdrant API endpoints.

### Changes
- Changed `create_qdrant_snapshot()` from full-storage to per-collection snapshots, iterating over all known collections
- Changed `restore_qdrant_snapshot()` from non-existent `POST /snapshots/upload` to valid `POST /collections/{name}/snapshots/upload`
- Changed `QDRANT_SNAPSHOT_SUFFIX` from `.qdrant.snapshot` (single file) to `.qdrant` (directory with per-collection files)
- Updated `_qdrant_snapshot_path_for()` to return a directory path
- Updated `list_backups()` to detect snapshot directories instead of files
- Updated `delete_backup()` and `auto_backup()` to clean up snapshot directories with `shutil.rmtree()`
- Updated CLI to calculate total snapshot size from directory contents
- Added `ALL_COLLECTIONS` constant derived from `CollectionName` for snapshot iteration
- Updated all tests to use directory-based mocks and verify per-collection API calls
- Added tests for partial restore (some collections exist, some don't)
