## BUG-053: Gate script timeout with force-kill

### Summary
Added a post-completion timeout mechanism to the gate script that force-kills pytest processes that hang after tests complete.

### Changes
- Added cleanup timer in claws-gate that starts after tests complete
- Implemented force-kill if pytest doesn't exit within 30 seconds
- Gate now fails (rather than passes) when cleanup timeout occurs, since cleanup failure indicates a resource leak
