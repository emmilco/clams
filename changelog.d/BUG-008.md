## BUG-008: Fix list_ghap_entries internal server error

### Summary
Fixed `list_ghap_entries` MCP tool returning internal server error by moving vector_store variable access from registration time to call time.

### Changes
- Moved `vector_store = persister._vector_store` from `get_ghap_tools()` scope into `list_ghap_entries` function body
- Eliminates closure timing issue where vector_store was captured before initialization
- Added MCP protocol regression test to verify the fix
