## BUG-069: Fix calm init missing skills/ and journal/ directories

### Summary
The `calm init` command was not creating the `skills/` and `journal/` directories,
resulting in an incomplete directory structure on fresh installations.

### Changes
- Added `settings.skills_dir` and `settings.journal_dir` to the directories list in `init_cmd.py`
- Updated the `init` command docstring to document all created directories
- Added regression test assertions for `skills/` and `journal/` directories
