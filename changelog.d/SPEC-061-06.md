## SPEC-061-06: Hooks and Skills Verification

### Summary
Verified that all CALM hooks fire correctly and skills load in a Claude Code session, with comprehensive test coverage.

### Changes
- Added integration tests (`test_hook_integration.py`) verifying standalone invocation of all four hooks via `python -m calm.hooks.<module>` with piped JSON stdin
- Added malformed input tests confirming hooks exit 0 and log errors (not crash) when given garbage, empty, or non-object JSON
- Added deployment verification tests (`test_hook_deployment.py`) confirming:
  - `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks section has correct schema for all four hook types
  - Skill SKILL.md files exist and are non-empty for orchestrate, wrapup, and reflection
  - `~/.claude/skills/skill-rules.json` is valid JSON with correct trigger patterns
- Total hook test count: 184 (153 existing + 31 new verification tests)
