## BUG-058: Auto-sync pip after worktree merge

### Summary
Added automatic dependency sync after worktree merges to prevent import failures when new dependencies are added.

### Changes
- Modified claws-worktree merge to run `uv sync` after successful merge
- Dependencies are now automatically installed when a worktree with new deps is merged
- Added regression test to verify sync runs after merge
