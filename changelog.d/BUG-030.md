## BUG-030: GHAP tools should return minimal responses to reduce token usage

### Summary
Optimized `start_ghap` and `resolve_ghap` to return minimal responses (`{"ok": true, "id": "..."}`) instead of echoing back full records.

### Changes
- Modified `start_ghap` to return `{"ok": true, "id": ghap_id}` instead of 8 fields
- Modified `resolve_ghap` to return `{"ok": true, "id": ghap_id}` instead of 4 fields
- Reduces token waste by ~500+ tokens per GHAP operation
- Added regression test to verify minimal response format
