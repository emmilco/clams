## SPEC-058-08: CALM Cleanup - Remove Deprecated Code

### Summary
Removed all deprecated CLAMS/CLAWS Python source code and stale configuration now that CALM is fully implemented. The repository now has a single Python package (`src/calm/`).

### Changes
- Removed `src/clams/` directory (74 source files across 14 subdirectories)
- Removed `.claude/roles/` directory (16 role files, now managed at `~/.calm/roles/`)
- Removed `.claude/hooks/` directory (3 pre-implementation hook stubs)
- Updated `pyproject.toml`: removed `clams-server` entry point, `src/clams` from packages, stale ruff/mypy config
- Removed ~200 test files that exclusively tested `src/clams/` code
- Moved `PlatformInfo` and `get_platform_info` to `calm.utils.platform` for continued use by test infrastructure
- Updated `tests/conftest.py` to import from `calm.utils.platform`, removed stale cold-start fixture imports and `get_server_command`
- Preserved all files needed by cutover script: `.claude/claws.db`, `scripts/cutover.py`, `.claude/bin/claws-*`, `clams_scripts/`
