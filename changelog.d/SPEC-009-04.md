## SPEC-009-04: Act 2 - Pipeline Visualization

### Summary
Implements the full 3D visualization for Act 2 of the CLAMS Animated Explainer, showing the GHAP → Embedding → Clustering → Value Formation pipeline.

### Changes
- Integrated Three.js 3D components (point-cloud, cluster-sphere, centroid) into Act 2
- Scene 2.2 (Embedding): Points appear in 3D space with staggered fade-in animations
- Scene 2.3 (Clustering): Cluster spheres form around point groups with elastic easing
- Scene 2.4 (Value Extraction): Centroids appear with scale pulse effect, spheres fade to highlight
- Added proper cleanup function for memory management
- Supports graceful degradation when 3D scene is not available
