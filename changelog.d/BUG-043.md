## BUG-043: Qdrant collections not auto-created on first use

### Summary
Fixed 404 errors when using memory, git commit, and value tools on fresh installations where Qdrant collections don't exist.

### Changes
- Added lazy collection creation (`_ensure_*_collection()` pattern) to:
  - Memory tools in `server/tools/memory.py`
  - GitAnalyzer in `git/analyzer.py`
  - ValueStore in `values/store.py`
- Collections are now automatically created on first use
- Pattern follows existing `CodeIndexer._ensure_collection()` implementation
- Added regression tests covering all three affected domains
