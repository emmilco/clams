## BUG-013: Fix search_commits AttributeError for missing score

### Summary
Fixed `search_commits` MCP tool failing with `'Commit' object has no attribute 'score'` by introducing a `CommitSearchResult` wrapper class that preserves similarity scores from vector search.

### Changes
- Added `CommitSearchResult` dataclass in `src/learning_memory_server/git/base.py`
- Modified `GitAnalyzer.search_commits()` to return `list[CommitSearchResult]` instead of `list[Commit]`
- Updated tool handler in `src/learning_memory_server/server/tools/git.py` to access commit data through the wrapper
- Added regression test in `tests/server/tools/test_git.py`

### Root Cause
`GitAnalyzer.search_commits()` was discarding the similarity score when converting `SearchResult` objects (which contain scores from vector search) to `Commit` objects (which don't have a score field). The tool handler then tried to access the non-existent `.score` attribute.
