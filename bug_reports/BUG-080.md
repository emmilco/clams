# Bug Report: BUG-080

## Title
5 dead MCP session/counter tools never removed after hook rewrite

## First Noticed On Commit
9eb86cd (current main HEAD)

## Reproduction Steps
1. Start the CALM MCP server
2. Call `list_tools` to see all registered tools
3. Observe that `start_session`, `get_orphaned_ghap`, `should_check_in`, `increment_tool_count`, and `reset_tool_count` are still registered
4. Verify that no production code (hooks or otherwise) calls these MCP tools

## Expected Behavior
After the hooks were rewritten to use file-based state (direct file I/O and SQLite queries) instead of MCP tool calls, the 5 session/counter MCP tools should have been removed since they are no longer called by anything.

## Actual Behavior
The 5 dead tools remained registered in the MCP server, adding unnecessary complexity to the tool list and confusing clients that enumerate available tools.

## Root Cause
When the hooks were rewritten in SPEC-008 to use file-based state instead of MCP tool calls, the corresponding MCP tools were not removed. The hooks now use:
- `session_start.py`: Direct SQLite queries for orphaned GHAP detection, file-based session ID
- `pre_tool_use.py`: File-based tool count persistence (`~/.calm/tool_count` JSON file), direct SQLite for active GHAP
- `post_tool_use.py`: Direct SQLite queries for active GHAP, no tool count interaction

The MCP tools in `src/calm/tools/session.py` (`start_session`, `get_orphaned_ghap`, `should_check_in`, `increment_tool_count`, `reset_tool_count`) used a completely separate `SessionManager` class with its own file-based state, but nothing ever called them.

Evidence:
- Grep of `src/calm/hooks/` shows zero imports from `calm.tools.session`
- Grep of all hooks shows they use `calm.hooks.common` utilities and direct SQLite, not MCP calls
- The `SessionManager` class and `get_session_tools` function were only referenced from `app.py` (registration), test files, and planning docs
- No production code path calls these 5 MCP tools

## Fix Plan
1. Remove the 5 tool definitions from `_get_all_tool_definitions()` in `app.py`
2. Remove the `SessionManager` instantiation and `get_session_tools()` registration from `create_server()`
3. Delete `src/calm/tools/session.py` entirely (contains only dead code)
4. Remove `get_session_tools` from `src/calm/tools/__init__.py`
5. Remove test files that tested the dead tools:
   - `tests/server/test_session_tools.py` (entire file)
   - `tests/server/tools/test_input_validation/test_session_validation.py` (entire file)
6. Remove session tool test classes from `tests/server/test_tool_response_schemas.py`
7. Remove `validate_frequency` import and tests from `tests/server/tools/test_validation.py`
8. Remove session_tools fixtures from conftest files
9. Update `scripts/verify_calm_setup.md` to remove session tools references
10. Add regression test verifying the removed tools are NOT in the registry
