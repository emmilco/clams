# BUG-029: GHAP start should error when active entry exists

## Reported

- **First noticed on commit**: 22902b24ba20f1df332c8504901132ff379cb2e4
- **Reported by**: orchestrator
- **Reported at**: 2025-12-10T02:36:00Z
- **Severity**: low

## Reproduction Steps

1. Call `start_ghap` to create a new GHAP entry
2. Without calling `resolve_ghap`, call `start_ghap` again with different parameters
3. Observe the error returned

**Expected**: A clear, helpful error message like `"Active GHAP exists (id: ghap_xxx). Resolve it first with resolve_ghap or abandon it."`

**Actual**: Returns generic `{"error": {"type": "internal_error", "message": "Internal server error"}}`

## Investigation (filled by Bug Investigator)

### Reproduction Confirmed

- [ ] Steps reproduced bug

**Observations during reproduction**:
[What did you observe when reproducing?]

### Initial Hypothesis

[What do you believe is causing this bug? Be specific: file, function, line.]

### Differential Diagnosis

| # | Hypothesis | If True, Would See | If False, Would See | Evidence | Status |
|---|------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | [Hypothesis A] | [Observable X] | [Observable Y] | [What you saw] | [Eliminated/Confirmed/Pending] |
| 2 | [Hypothesis B] | [Observable Z] | [Observable W] | [What you saw] | [Eliminated/Confirmed/Pending] |
| 3 | [Hypothesis C] | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Evidentiary Scaffold

**Logging/assertions added**:
```python
# Location: file.py:123
# Purpose: Distinguish between hypothesis 1 and 2
logger.debug(f"State at critical point: {state}")
```

**Test command**:
```bash
[Command to run with scaffold in place]
```

**Captured output**:
```
[Actual output from scaffold run]

### Root Cause (Proven)

**The bug is caused by**: [Specific root cause]

**Evidence**: [What proves this is the cause]

**Why alternatives were eliminated**:
- Hypothesis 1 eliminated because: [reason with evidence]
- Hypothesis 3 eliminated because: [reason with evidence]

## Fix Plan

### Code Changes

1. **File**: `src/clams/server/tools/ghap.py` (or wherever start_ghap is implemented)
   **Function**: `start_ghap` tool handler
   **Change**: Check for active GHAP before creating new one; return specific error with active GHAP ID
   **Rationale**: Clear error messages help agents self-correct without confusion

### Regression Test

**Test file**: `tests/server/tools/test_bug_029_regression.py`

**Test should**:
1. Create a GHAP entry with start_ghap
2. Attempt to create another without resolving
3. Verify error type is `active_ghap_exists` (not `internal_error`)
4. Verify error message includes the active GHAP ID
5. Verify error message suggests resolution action

**Test outline**:
```python
async def test_bug_029_start_ghap_with_active_returns_helpful_error():
    # Setup: create an active GHAP
    result1 = await start_ghap(domain="debugging", ...)
    assert "id" in result1

    # Action: try to create another
    result2 = await start_ghap(domain="testing", ...)

    # Assert: get helpful error, not internal_error
    assert "error" in result2
    assert result2["error"]["type"] == "active_ghap_exists"
    assert result1["id"] in result2["error"]["message"]
    assert "resolve_ghap" in result2["error"]["message"]
```

### Verification

After implementing the fix:
```bash
# Run specific test
pytest tests/server/tools/test_bug_029_regression.py -xvs

# Run full test suite
pytest -xvs
```
