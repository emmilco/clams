# BUG-070: Missing directory checks in verify_install.py and steps.py

## Status: FIXED

## First noticed on commit
4145288 (main, Feb 7 2026)

## Reproduction steps
1. Run `scripts/verify_install.py` and observe it only checks for `~/.calm`, `sessions/`, `roles/`, and `workflows/` directories
2. Run `calm install` and observe that `step_verify()` only checks `["roles", "workflows", "skills", "sessions"]` -- missing `journal/`
3. Note that `create_directory_structure()` in `templates.py` creates 6 subdirectories: `workflows/`, `roles/`, `skills/`, `sessions/`, `journal/`
4. The verification functions don't check all directories that installation creates

## Expected behavior
Both verification functions should check for ALL directories that the installer creates: `roles/`, `workflows/`, `skills/`, `sessions/`, and `journal/`.

## Actual behavior
- `verify_storage_directory()` in `scripts/verify_install.py` only checks 3 of 5 subdirectories (missing `skills/` and `journal/`)
- `step_verify()` in `src/calm/install/steps.py` only checks 4 of 5 subdirectories (missing `journal/`)

## Root cause
When `journal/` was added to `create_directory_structure()` in `templates.py` and when `skills/` was added as a template category, the corresponding verification functions were not updated to include these new directories in their checks.

## Evidence
- `templates.py` line 230-237: `create_directory_structure()` creates `workflows/`, `roles/`, `skills/`, `sessions/`, `journal/`
- `verify_install.py` line 61-69: Only checks `sessions/`, `roles/`, `workflows/` (missing `skills/` and `journal/`)
- `steps.py` line 296: `dirs_to_check = ["roles", "workflows", "skills", "sessions"]` (missing `journal/`)

## Fix plan

### File 1: `scripts/verify_install.py`
Add `skills_dir` and `journal_dir` variables and include them in the `checks` list.

### File 2: `src/calm/install/steps.py`
Add `"journal"` to the `dirs_to_check` list at line 296.

### Regression tests
Add tests that verify the verification functions catch missing `skills/` and `journal/` directories.
