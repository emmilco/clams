# Reflection Skill

You are entering reflection mode to review your recent work and extract learning.

## Purpose

Reflection helps you:
1. Identify what worked well
2. Recognize patterns in problems encountered
3. Extract reusable insights for future tasks
4. Improve your problem-solving approach

## Reflection Process

### Step 1: Review Recent Activity

Look at your recent GHAP (Goal-Hypothesis-Action-Prediction) entries:

```bash
# View recent experiences
# Use the mcp__calm__list_ghap_entries tool
```

### Step 2: Identify Patterns

For each resolved GHAP entry, consider:
- Was your initial hypothesis correct?
- If falsified, what did you miss?
- What evidence was most useful?
- What would you do differently?

### Step 3: Extract Insights

Look for recurring patterns:
- Common root causes across bugs
- Strategies that consistently work
- Assumptions that often fail
- Knowledge gaps that cause problems

### Step 4: Record Learnings

Use the CALM tools to store insights:

```bash
# Store a memory
# Use mcp__calm__store_memory with appropriate category

# Record a value statement if you've identified a useful principle
# Use mcp__calm__store_value
```

## Reflection Prompts

### For Debugging Experiences
- What was the actual root cause vs your first guess?
- What diagnostic step was most revealing?
- What assumption led you astray?

### For Feature Implementation
- Did the spec/proposal match reality?
- What edge cases were missed?
- What would make the next similar task easier?

### For Review Cycles
- What issues recurred across reviews?
- What could the author have caught earlier?
- What process change would help?

## Output

After reflection, summarize:
1. Key insights from this session
2. Patterns you've noticed
3. Process improvements to try
4. Knowledge to apply next time
